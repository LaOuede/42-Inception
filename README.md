<h1 align=center>Inception</h1>

<div align=center>

The <b>Inception</b> project focuses on learning Docker and Docker-compose. The objective is to set up a network of three Docker containers: one for Nginx, one for WordPress, and one for MariaDB. These containers must interact over the Docker network to host a local website. This project covers the deployment of multiple interdependent containers, network configurations, persistent storage, and security practices, providing a comprehensive foundation in cloud infrastructure.
